sql Queries:
1. select grade,count(distinct(customer_id)) from customers group by grade having grade > (select avg(grade) from customers where city = 'bangalore');
2. select salesman_id,name from salesman where 1 < (select count(*) from customers where salesman_id = salesman.salesman_id);
3. select name,cust_name from salesman s,customers c,orders o where s.salesman_id=o.salesman_id and o.customer_id=c.customer_id and o.purchase_amt>4000; 
4. delete from salesman where salesman_id = 1000;
